## Description
Rust reimplementation of `tcpliveplay`
(https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/tcpliveplay-man.html) with
modification for special use case (having sent data sent back after fin)

The implementation is split into two files lib.rs contains the program
logic exposes one main function `replay` that takes all necessary
parameters to `replay` a pcap file against a live target (similar to
`tcpliveplay`). This function can easily be used by other rust code ( it
is used by the test framework).
The main.rs files implements a command line program that parses all
arguments to `replay` from the command line and runs `replay`.
The command line tool can be run by:

```sudo cargo run -- -I wlp2s0 -f ../test_framework/attacks/J.pcap -i 192.168.8.31 -p 5555 -m 08:00:27:95:bd:54 -v```

The program needs to be run with super user priviledges or alternativly
run the the `CAP_NET_RAW` linux capability.
The -- indicates the end of the cargo arguments.
